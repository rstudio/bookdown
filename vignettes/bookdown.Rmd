If you are new to **R Markdown**, we recommend you start with [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html) to get an overview. [Part I](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html) introduces how to install the relevant packages, and provides an overview of R Markdown, including the possible output formats, the Markdown syntax, the R code chunk syntax, and how to use other languages in R Markdown.

Next, the chapter on [_Books_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html) will help orient you to how the **bookdown** package allows you to use R Markdown to author books, using single or multiple `.Rmd` files to build your content.


# User Guide

Written by Yihui Xie, the package author, [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) introduces the R package and how to use it. The book is published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, and you can read it online for free.

The book is structured into several chapters to guide the reader into the use of the R package **bookdown** to write books: 

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# run this to update the content below
xfun::pkg_attach2("xml2")
html <- read_html("https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/")
chapters <- xml_find_all(html, "//li[@class='chapter']")
first_level <- chapters[which(purrr::map_lgl(xml_attr(chapters, 'data-level'), ~ grepl('^\\d+$', .x)))]
titles <- xml_text(xml_find_all(first_level, "a"))
titles <- gsub("^(\\d+)", "\\1.", titles)
titles <- gsub("^(.*) \\([*])$", "\\1", titles)
url <- file.path("https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown", xml_attr(first_level, "data-path"))
formatted <- sprintf("* [%s](%s)", titles, url)
cat(formatted, sep = "\n")
```
