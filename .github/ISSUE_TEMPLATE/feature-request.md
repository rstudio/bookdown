Welcome to the bookdown GitHub repo ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to file a feature request! Please start by searching for an existing feature request to avoid creating duplicate requests. If you find an existing feature request, please give it a thumbs-up reaction, as we'll use these reactions to help prioritize the implementation of these features in the future.

If the feature has not yet been filed, follow these advice to write good feature request: 

- Provide a clear and concise description of the problem this proposed feature would address? For example, I struggle to do `[...]` with bookdown.

- Try to detail what you want to happen.

- Have you thought of alternative solutions or workarounds you've considered ? We'll be glad to know about them!

- Any other context or screenshots about your feature request that would help us understand ? Please include them!


If you'd also like to offer a solution, you are welcome to submit a pull request, although we appreciate filing an issue first to confirm that the team agrees with your idea and is happy with your basic proposal. Please read this guide for more information: <https://yihui.org/issue/#proposing-a-feature-implementation-or-bug-fix>
