By filing an issue to this repo, I promise that

- [ ] I have fully read the issue guide at https://yihui.name/issue/.
- [ ] I have provided the necessary information about my issue.
    - If I'm asking a question, I have already asked it on Stack Overflow or RStudio Community, waited for at least 24 hours, and included a link to my question there.
    - If I'm filing a bug report, I have included a minimal, self-contained, and reproducible example, and have also included `xfun::session_info('bookdown')`. I have upgraded all my packages to their latest versions (e.g., R, RStudio, and R packages), and also tried the development version: `remotes::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')`.
    - If I have posted the same issue elsewhere, I have also mentioned it in this issue.
- [ ] I have learned the Github Markdown syntax, and formatted my issue correctly.

I understand that my issue may be closed if I don't fulfill my promises.
