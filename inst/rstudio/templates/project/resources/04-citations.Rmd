# Citations 

You can include citations as you write. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added in the external file book.bib). 

Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.

The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>
