## Equations

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
