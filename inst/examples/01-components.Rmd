# Components

In this chapter, we show the syntax of some basic components of a book, including R code, figures, tables, citations, and so on. First we start with the syntax of Pandoc's Markdown.

## Markdown syntax

We give a very brief introduction to Pandoc's Markdown in this section. Readers who are familiar with Markdown can skip this section. The comprehensive syntax of Pandoc's Markdown can be found on the Pandoc website <http://pandoc.org>.

You can make text _italic_ by surrounding it with underscores or asterisks, e.g., `_text_` or `*text*`. For **bold** text, use two underscores (`__text__`) or asterisks (`**text**`). Text surrounded by `~` will be converted to a subscript (e.g., `H~2~SO~4~` renders H~2~SO~4~), and similarly, two carets like `^` produces a superscript (e.g., `ClO^-^` renders ClO^-^). To mark text as `inline code`, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `` `code` ``^[To include literal backticks, just use more backticks outside, e.g., you can use two backticks to preserve one backtick inside: ``` `` `code` `` ```.]. Small caps can be produced by the HTML tag `span`, e.g., `<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small caps</span>` renders <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small caps</span>. Links are created using `[text](link)`, e.g., `[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)`, and the syntax for images is similar: just add an exclamation mark, e.g., `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)`. Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`, e.g., `^[This is a footnote.]`. We will talk about citations in Section \@ref(citations). Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,

```
# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header
```

If you do not want a certain heading to be numbered, you can add `{-}` after the heading, e.g.,

```
# Preface {-}
```

There are a few special types of first-level headers that will be processed differently in **bookdown**. The first type is an unnumbered header that starts with the token `(PART)`. This kind of headers are translated to part titles. If you are familiar with LaTeX, this basically means `\part{}`. When your book has a large number of chapters, you may want to organize them into parts, e.g.,

```
# (PART) Part I {-} 

# Chapter One

# Chapter Two

# (PART) Part II {-} 

# Chapter Three
```

The second type is an unnumbered header that starts with `(APPENDIX)`, indicating that all chapters after this header are appendices, e.g.,

```
# Chapter One 

# Chapter Two

# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} 

# Appendix A

# Appendix B
```

The numbering style of appendices will be automatically changed in LaTeX/PDF and HTML output (usually in the form A, A.1, A.2, B, B.1, ...). This feature is not available to e-books.

Unordered list items start with `*`, `-`, or `+`, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list by four spaces, e.g.,

```
- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one item
    - one item
```

The output is:

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one item
    - one item

Ordered list items start with numbers (the rule for nested lists is the same as above), e.g.,

```
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
```

The output does not look too much different with the Markdown source:

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item

Blockquotes are written after `>`, e.g.,

```
> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain
```

The actual output:

> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain

Plain code blocks can be written after three or more backticks, and you can also indent the blocks by four spaces, e.g.,

````
```
This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
```

Or indent by four spaces:

    This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
````

Inline LaTeX equations can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., `$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$` (actual output: $f(k)={n \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$); math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., `$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$`, and the output looks like this:

$$f\left(k\right)=\binom{n}{k}p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$$

To number and refer to equations, put them in the equation environments and assign labels to them, e.g.,

```latex
\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  \label{eq:binom}
\end{equation} 
```

It renders the equation below:

\begin{equation}
f\left(k\right)=\binom{n}{k}p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k} \label{eq:binom}
\end{equation}

You may refer to it using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, e.g., see Equation \@ref(eq:binom). Due to some technical constraints, you must label your equations with the prefix `eq:` in **bookdown**.

## R code

There are two types of R code in R Markdown/**knitr** documents: R code chunks, and inline R code. The syntax for the latter is `` ``r ''`r R_CODE` ``, and it can be embedded inline with other document elements. R code chunks look like plain code blocks, but has `{r}` after the three backticks and (optionally) chunk options inside `{}`, e.g.,

    `r ''````{r chunk-label, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
    1 + 1
    rnorm(10)  # 10 random numbers
    plot(dist ~ speed, cars)  # a scatterplot
    ```

To learn more about **knitr** chunk options, see @xie2015 or <http://yihui.name/knitr/options>. For books, additional R code can be executed before/after each chapter; see `before_chapter_script` and `after_chapter_script` in Section \@ref(configuration).

## Figures {#figures}

By default, figures have no captions in the output generated by **knitr**, which means they will just be placed wherever they were generated in the R code. Below is such an example.

```{r no-caption, fig.width=6, fig.asp=.7, out.width='70%', ref.label='pressure-plot'}
```

The disadvantage of typesetting figures in this way is that when there is not enough space on the current page to place a figure, it may either reach the bottom of the page (hence exceeds the page margin), or be pushed to the next page, leaving a large white margin at the bottom of the current page. That is basically why there are "floating environments" in LaTeX: elements that cannot be split over multiple pages (like figures) are put in floating environments, so they can float to a page that has enough space to hold them. There is also a disadvantage of floating things forward or backward, though. That is, readers may have to jump to a different page to find the figure mentioned on the current page. This is simply a natural consequence of having to typeset things on multiple pages of fixed sizes. This issue does not exist in HTML, however, since everything can be placed continuously on one single page (presumably with infinite height), and there is no need to split anything across multiple pages of the same page size.

If we assign a figure caption to a code chunk via the chunk option `fig.cap`, R plots will be put into figure environments, which will be automatically labeled and numbered, and can also be cross-referenced. The label of a figure environment is generated from the label of the code chunk, e.g., if the chunk label is `foo`, the figure label will be `fig:foo` (the prefix `fig:` is added before `foo`). To reference a figure, use the syntax `\@ref(label)`^[Do not forget the leading backslash!], where `label` is the figure label, e.g., `fig:foo`.

```{block, type='rmdimportant'}
If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-). Other characters do not qualify.
```


The chunk option `fig.asp` can be used to set the aspect ratio of plots, i.e., the ratio of figure height/width. If the figure width is 6 inches (`fig.width = 6`) and `fig.asp = 0.7`, the figure height will be automatically calculated from `fig.width * fig.asp = 6 * 0.7 = 4.2`. Figure \@ref(fig:pressure-plot) is an example using the chunk options `fig.asp = 0.7`, `fig.width = 6`, and `fig.align = 'center'`, generated from the code below:

```{r pressure-plot, fig.asp=.7, fig.width=6, fig.cap='A figure example with the specified aspect ratio, width, and alignment.', fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, pch = 19, type = 'b')
```

The actual size of a plot is determined by the chunk options `fig.width` and `fig.height` (the size of the plot generated from a graphical device), and we can specify the output size of plots via the chunk options `out.width` and `out.height`. The possible value of these two options depends on the output format of the document. For example, `out.width = '30%'` is a valid value for HTML output, but not for LaTeX/PDF output. However, **knitr** will automatically convert a percentage value for `out.width` of the form `x%` to `(x / 100) \linewidth`, e.g., `out.width = '70%'` will be treated as `.7\linewidth` when the output format is LaTeX. This makes it possible to specify a relative width of a plot in a consistent manner. Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot) is an example of `out.width = 70%`.

```{r cars-plot, out.width='70%', fig.cap='A figure example with a relative width 70\\%.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```

If you want to put multiple plots in one figure environment, you must use the chunk option `fig.show = 'hold'` to hold multiple plots from a code chunk and include them in one environment. You can also place plots side by side if the sum of the width of all plots is smaller than or equal to the current line width. For example, if two plots have the same width `50%`, they will be placed side by side. Similarly, you can specify `out.width = '33%'` to arrange three plots on one line. Figure \@ref(fig:multi-plots) is an example of two plots, each with a width `50%`.

```{r multi-plots, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Two plots placed side by side.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, pch = 19, type = 'b')
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```

Sometimes you may have certain images that are not generated from R code, and you can include them them in R Markdown via the function `knitr::include_graphics()`. Figure \@ref(fig:knitr-logo) is an example of three **knitr** logos included in a figure environment. You may pass one or multiple image paths to the `include_graphics()` function, and all chunk options that apply to normal R plots also apply to these images, e.g., you can use `out.width = '33%'` to set the widths of these images in the output document.

```{r knitr-logo, out.width='33%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Three knitr logos included in the document from an external PNG image file.'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/knit-logo.png', 3))
```

There are a few advantages of using `include_graphics()`:

1. You do not need to worry about the document output format, e.g., when the output format is LaTeX, you may have to use the LaTeX command `\includegraphics{}` to include an image, and when the output format is Markdown, you have to use `![]()`. The function `include_graphics()` in **knitr** takes care of these details automatically.
1. The syntax for controlling the image attributes is the same as when images are generated from R code, e.g., chunk options `fig.cap`, `out.width`, and `fig.show` still have the same meanings.
1. `include_graphics()` is smart enough to use PDF graphics automatically when the output format is LaTeX and the PDF graphics files exist, e.g., an image path `foo/bar.png` can be automatically replaced with `foo/bar.pdf` if the latter exists. PDF images often have better qualities than raster images in LaTeX/PDF output. Of course, you can disable this feature by `include_graphics(auto_pdf = FALSE)` if you do not like it.
1. You can easily scale these images proportionally using the same ratio. This can be done via the `dpi` argument (dots per inch), which takes the value from the chunk option `dpi` by default. If it is a numeric value and the chunk option `out.width` is not set, the output width of an image will be its actual width (in pixels) divided by `dpi`, and the unit will be inches. For example, for an image with the size 672 x 480, its output width will be 7 inches (`7in`) when `dpi = 96`. This feature requires the package **png** and/or **jpeg** to be installed. You can always override the automatic calculation of width in inches by providing a non-NULL value to the chunk option `out.wdith`, or use `include_graphics(dpi = NA)`.

## Tables {#tables}

For now, the most convenient way to generate a table is the function `knitr::kable()`, because there are some internal tricks in **knitr** to make it work with **bookdown** and users do not have to know anything about these implementation details. We will explain how to use other packages and functions later in this section.

Like figures, tables with captions will also be numbered and can be referenced. The `kable()` function will automatically generate a label for a table environment, which is the prefix `tab:` plus the chunk label. For example, the table label for a code chunk with the label `foo` will be `tab:foo`, and we can still use the syntax `\@ref(label)` to reference the table. Table \@ref(tab:table-single) is a simple example.

```{r table-single, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars, 10), booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 10 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```

If you want to put multiple tables in a single table environment, just wrap the data objects (usually data frames in R) into a list. See Table \@ref(tab:table-multi) for an example.

```{r table-multi, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  list(
    head(iris[,1:2],3),
    head(mtcars[,1:3],5)
  ),
  caption = 'A Tale of Two Tables.', booktabs = TRUE
)
```

When you do not want a table to float in PDF, you may use the LaTeX package [**longtable**](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/longtable), which can break a table across multiple pages. To use **longtable**, just pass `longtable = TRUE` to `kable()`, and make sure to include `\usepackage{longtable}` in the LaTeX preamble (see Section \@ref(yaml-options) for how to customize the LaTeX preamble). Of course, this is irrelevant to HTML output, since tables in HTML do not need to float.

```{r longtable, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:100, ], longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table generated by the longtable package.'
)
```

If you decide to use other packages to generate tables, you have to make sure the label for the table environment appears in the beginning of the table caption in the form `(\#label)`, where `label` must have the prefix `tab:`. You have to be very careful about the _portability_ of the table generating function: it should work for both HTML and LaTeX output automatically, so it must consider the output format internally (check `knitr::opts_knit$get('pandoc.to')`). When writing out an HTML table, the caption must be written in the `<caption></caption>` tag. For simple tables, `kable()` should suffice. If you have to create complicated tables (e.g., with certain cells spanning across multiple columns/rows), you will have to take the aforementioned issues into consideration.

## Cross-references

We have explained how cross-references work for figures (Section \@ref(figures)) and tables (Section \@ref(tables)). In fact, you can also reference sections using the same syntax `\@ref(label)`, where `label` is the section ID. By default, Pandoc will generate an ID for all section headers, e.g., a section `# Hello World` will have an ID `hello-world`. We recommend you to manually assign an ID to a section header to make sure you do not forget to update the reference label after you change the section header. To assign an ID to a section header, simply add `{#id}` to the end of the section header.

When a referenced label cannot be found, you will see two question marks like \@ref(fig:does-not-exist), as well as a warning message in the R console when rendering the book.

You can also create text-based links using explicit or automatic section IDs or even the actual section header text.

  * If you're happy with the section header as the link text, use it inside a single set of square brackets:
    - `[Section header text]`: example [A single document]
  * There are three ways to specify custom link text:
    - `[link text][Section header text]`: example [non-English books][Internationalization]
    - `[link text](#explicitID)`: example [Table stuff](#tables)
    - `[link text](#autoID)`: example [How to build your book](#build-the-book)

The Pandoc documentation provides more detail on [automatic section IDs](http://pandoc.org/README.html#extension-auto_identifiers) and [implicit header references](http://pandoc.org/README.html#extension-implicit_header_references).

## Custom blocks

You can generate custom blocks using the `block` engine in **knitr**, i.e., the chunk option `engine = 'block'`, or the more compact syntax ```` ```{block} ````. This engine should be used in conjunction with the chunk option `type`, which takes a character string. When the `block` engine is used, it generates a `<div>` to wrap the chunk content if the output format is HTML, and a LaTeX environment if the output is LaTeX. The `type` option specifies the class of the `<div>` and the name of the LaTeX environment. For example, the HTML output of this chunk

    `r ''````{block, type='FOO'}
    Some text for this block.
    ```

will be this:

    <div class="FOO">
    Some text for this block.
    </div>

and the LaTeX output will be this:

    \begin{FOO}
    Some text for this block.
    \end{FOO}

It is up to the book author how to define the style of the block. You can define the style of the `<div>` in CSS and include it in the output via the `includes` option in the YAML metadata. Similarly, you may define the LaTeX environment via `\newenvironment` and include the definition in the LaTeX output via the `includes` option. For example, we may save the following style in a CSS file, say, `style.css`:

```css
div.FOO {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;
}
```

And the YAML metadata of the R Markdown document can be:

```yaml
---
output:
  bookdown::html_chapters:
    includes:
      in_header: style.css
---
```

We have defined a few types of blocks for this book to show notes, tips, and warnings, etc. Below are some examples:

```{block, note-text, type='rmdnote'}
R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.
For more information about these matters see
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
```

```{block, note-text, type='rmdcaution'}
```


```{block, note-text, type='rmdimportant'}
```

```{block, note-text, type='rmdtip'}
```

```{block, note-text, type='rmdwarning'}
```

Custom blocks are designed to display simple content (typically a paragraph of plain text). You can use simple formatting syntax such as making certain words bold or italic, but more advanced syntax such as citations and cross-references will not work.

## Citations {#citations}

Although Pandoc supports multiple ways of writing citations, we recommend you to use BibTeX databases because they work best with LaTeX/PDF output. Pandoc can process other types of bibliography databases with the utility `pandoc-citeproc` (<https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc>), but it may not render certain bibliography items correctly (especially in case of multiple authors). With BibTeX databases, you will be able to define the bibiliography style if it is required by a certain publisher or journal.

A BibTeX database is a plain-text file (with the conventional filename extension `.bib`) that consists of bibliography entries like this:

```bibtex
@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2015},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```

A bibliography entry starts with `@type{`, where `type` may be `article`, `book`, `manual`, and so on. Then there is a citation key, like `R-base` in the above example. To cite an entry, use `@key` or `[@key]` (the latter puts the citation in braces), e.g., `@R-base` is rendered to @R-base, and `[@R-base]` generates "[@R-base]". If you are familiar with the **natbib** package in LaTeX, `@key` is basically `\citet{key}`, and `[@key]` is equivalent to `\citep{key}`.

There are a number of fields in a bibliography entry, such as `title`, `author`, and `year`, etc. You may see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX for possible types of entries and fields in BibTeX.

There is a helper function `write_bib()` in **knitr** to generate BibTeX entries automatically for R packages. Note it only generates one BibTeX entry for the package itself at the moment, whereas a package may contain multiple entries in the `CITATION` file, and some entries are about the publications related to the package. These entries are ignored by `write_bib()`.

```{r write-bib, comment='', warning=FALSE}
# the second argument can be a .bib file
knitr::write_bib(c('knitr', 'stringr'), '')
```

Once you have got one or multiple `.bib` files, you may use the field `bibliography` in the YAML metadata of your R Markdown document, and you can also specify the bibliography style via `biblio-style` (this only applies to PDF output), e.g.,

```yaml
---
bibliography: ["one.bib", "another.bib", "yet-another.bib"]
biblio-style: "apalike"
link-citations: true
---
```

The field `link-citations` can be used to add internal links from the citation text of the author-year style to the bibilography entry in the HTML output.

## HTML widgets

Although one of R's greatest strengths is data visualization, there are a large number of JavaScript libraries for much richer data visualization. These libraries can be used to build interactive applications that can easily render in web browsers, so users do not need to install any additional software packages to view the visualizations. One way to bring these JavaScript libraries into R is through the [**htmlwidgets**](http://htmlwidgets.org) package [@R-htmlwidgets]. 

HTML widgets can be rendered as a standalone web page (just like an R plot), or embedded in R Markdown documents and Shiny applications. They were originally designed for HTML output only, and they require the availability of JavaScript, so they will not work in non-HTML output formats, such as LaTeX/PDF. Before **knitr** v1.13, you will get an error when you render HTML widgets to an output format that is not HTML. Since **knitr** v1.13, HTML widgets will be rendered automatically as screenshots taken via the **webshot** package [@R-webshot]. Of course, you need to install the **webshot** package. Additionally, you have to install PhantomJS (http://phantomjs.org), since it is what **webshot** uses to capture screenshots. Both **webshot** and PhantomJS can be installed automatically from R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('webshot')
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```

The function `install_phantomjs()` works for Windows, OS X, and Linux. You may also choose to download and install PhantomJS by yourself, if you are familiar with modifying the system environment variable `PATH`.

When **knitr** detects an HTML widget object in a code chunk, it either renders the widget normally when the current output format is HTML, or saves the widget as an HTML page and calls **webshot** to capture the screen of the HTML page when the output format is not HTML. Here is an example of a table created from the **DT** package [@R-DT]:

```{r DT-demo, fig.cap='A table widget rendered via the DT package.', dev='png', cache=TRUE, cache.extra=packageVersion('DT')}
DT::datatable(iris)
```

If you are reading this book as web pages now, you should see an interactive table generated from the above code chunk, e.g., you may sort the columns and search in the table. If you are reading a non-HTML version of this book, you should see a screenshot of the table. The screenshot may look a little different with the actual widget rendered in the web browser, due to the difference between a real web browser and PhantomJS' virtual browser.

There are a number of **knitr** chunk options related to screen-capturing. First, if you are not satisfied with the quality of the automatic screenshots, or want a screenshot of the widget of a particular state (e.g., after you click and sort a certain column of a table), you may capture the screen manually, and provide your own screenshot via the chunk option `screenshot.alt` (alternative screenshots). This option takes the paths of images. If you have multiple widgets in a chunk, you can provide a vector of image paths. When this option is present, **knitr** will no longer call **webshot** to take automatic screenshots.

Second, sometimes you may want to force **knitr** to use static screenshots instead of rendering the actual widgets even on HTML pages. In this case, you can set the chunk option `screenshot.force = TRUE`, and widgets will always be rendered as static images. Note you can still choose to use automatic or custom screenshots.

Third, **webshot** has some options to control the automatic screenshots, and you may specify these options via the chunk option `screenshot.opts`, which takes a list like `list(delay = 2, cliprect = 'viewport')`. See the help page `?webshot::webshot` for the full list of possible options, and the [package vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/webshot/vignettes/intro.html) `vignette('intro', package = 'webshot')` has illustrated the effect of these options. Here the `delay` option can be important for widgets that take long time to render: `delay` specifies the number of seconds to wait before PhantomJS takes the screenshot. If you see an incomplete screenshot, you may want to specify a longer delay (the default is 0.2 seconds).

Fourth, if you feel it is slow to capture the screenshots, or do not want to do it every time the code chunk is executed, you may use the chunk option `cache = TRUE` to cache the chunk. Caching works for both HTML and non-HTML output formats.

Screenshots behave like normal R plots in the sense that many chunk options related to figures also apply to screenshots, including `fig.width`, `fig.height`, `out.width`, `fig.cap`, and so on. So you can specify the size of screenshots in the output document, and assign figure captions to them as well. The image format of the automatic screenshots can be specified via the chunk option `dev`, and possible values are `pdf`, `png`, and `jpeg`. The default for PDF output is `pdf`, and it is `png` for other types of output. Note `pdf` may not work as faithfully as `png`: sometimes there are certain elements on an HTML page that fail to render to the PDF screenshot, so you may want to use `dev = 'png'` even for PDF output. It depends on specific cases of HTML widgets, and you can try both `pdf` and `png` (or `jpeg`) before deciding which format is more desirable.

## Web pages and Shiny apps

Similar to HTML widgets, arbitrary web pages can be embedded in the book. You can use the function `knitr::include_url()` to include a web page through its URL. When the output format is HTML, an `iframe` is used^[An `iframe` is basically a box on one web page to embed another web page.]; in other cases, **knitr** tries to take a screenshot of the web page (or use the custom screenshot you provided). All chunk options are the same as those for HTML widgets. One option that may require your special attention is the `delay` option: HTML widgets are rendered locally, so usually they are fast to load for PhantomJS to take screenshots, but an arbitrary URL may take longer to load, so you may want to use a larger `delay` value, e.g., use the chunk option `screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5)`.

A related function is `knitr::include_app()`, which is very similar to `include_url()`, and it was designed for embedding Shiny apps via their URLs in the output. Its only difference with `include_url()` is that it automatically adds a query parameter `?showcase=0` to the URL, if no other query parameters are present in the URL, to disable the Shiny showcase mode, which is unlikely to be useful for screenshots or iframes. If you do want the showcase mode, just use `include_url()` instead of `include_app()`. Below is a Shiny app example (Figure \@ref(fig:miniUI)):

```{r miniUI, fig.cap='A Shiny app created via the miniUI package: https://yihui.shinyapps.io/miniUI/.', screenshot.opts=list(delay=10), dev='png', cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
knitr::include_app('https://yihui.shinyapps.io/miniUI/', height = '600px')
```

Again, you will see a live app if you are reading an HTML version of this book, and a static screenshot if you are reading other types of formats. The above Shiny app was created using the **miniUI** package [@R-miniUI], which provides layout functions that are particularly nice for Shiny apps on small screens. If you use normal Shiny layout functions, you are likely to see vertical and/or horizontal scrollbars in the iframes because the page size is too big to fit an iframe. When the default width of the iframe is too small, you may use the chunk option `out.width` to change it. For the height of the iframe, use the `height` argument of `include_url()`/`include_app()`.

Shiny apps may take even longer to load than usual URLs. You may want to use a conservative value for the `delay` option, e.g., 10. Needless to say, `include_url()` and `include_app()` require a working Internet connection, unless you have previously cached the chunk (but web pages inside iframes still will not work without an Internet connection).
