# About the Author {-}

Yihui Xie (<http://yihui.org>) is a software engineer at RStudio (<http://www.rstudio.com>). He earned his PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. He is interested in interactive statistical graphics and statistical computing. As an active R user, he has authored several R packages, such as **knitr**, **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **animation**, **DT**, **tinytex**, **tufte**, **formatR**, **fun**, **mime**, **highr**, **servr**, and **Rd2roxygen**, among which the **animation** package won the 2009 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award (ASA). He also co-authored a few other R packages, including **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and **leaflet**.

In 2006, he founded the Capital of Statistics (<https://cosx.org>), which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. He initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and has been involved in organizing R conferences in China since then. During his PhD training at Iowa State University, he won the Vince Sposito Statistical Computing Award (2011) and the Snedecor Award (2012) in the Department of Statistics.

He occasionally rants on Twitter (https://twitter.com/xieyihui), and most of the time you can find him on GitHub (https://github.com/yihui).

He enjoys spicy food as much as classical Chinese literature.
